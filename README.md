# FEPrep-Summer2021

Code base partitioned into the 12 sections assessed by the University of Central Florida's Foundation Exam.

Each partition will contain one program that covers any fundamental operations that I feel are demonstrative 
of basic proficiency with the topic in question as well as solutions to selected problems.

The problems are sourced from previous examinations, with priority given to those questions reported to 
have the lowest rate of success among students, which I am correlating with difficulty.
