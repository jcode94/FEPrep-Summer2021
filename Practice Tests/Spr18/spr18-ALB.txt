a.
in the worst case, quick sort runs more slowly than merge sort because of the 
instability of the pivot selection, which can causes unnecessary comparisons on
an array with many duplicates.

b.
"in place" means that the mechanical operations performed by partition are done
without additional space requirements. A synonym for in place is "on line".
